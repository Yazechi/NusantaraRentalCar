        - There will be two order buttons, one is order from whatsapp where users will be redirected to the owner whatsapp and can proceed with the order by communication, the other order button is directly from the website, where user will add this information before confirming their order, that is the duration of the rental, the date of the rental, and wether they want the car to be delivered to their place or take it themself.
